## Backend Developer Coding Challenge

### Notes

- Project was built out in Laravel 10
- You will need to run the following command to generate an app key in your local `.env` file:
  ```php artisan key:generate```
- 60 minute time constraint resulted in little functionality being completed.
- Work planned but still remaining:
  - Actual implementation of CRUD routes and functionality
  - Adding tests (none were added since functionality was incomplete)
  - Build out of Vue UI for CRUD functionality
  - Manual testing to validate completion
